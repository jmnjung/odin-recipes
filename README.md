Each recipe is designed to be straightforward yet delicious, making them perfect for busy students and home cooks alike.

## Recipes Included

### 1. Bulgogi

Bulgogi is a beloved Korean dish featuring marinated beef that is either grilled or stir-fried.
The marinade combines soy sauce, sesame oil, garlic, and a touch of sweetness to deliver a rich, savory flavor.
This dish is ideal for a quick, flavorful meal.

### 2. Aglio e Olio

A classic Italian pasta dish, Aglio e Olio is made with spaghetti, garlic, olive oil, red pepper flakes, and parsley.
It is renowned for its simplicity and speed, yet it offers a delightful balance of garlicky, spicy, and aromatic flavors.

### 3. Salmon Steak

Salmon steak is a nutritious and sophisticated choice, pan-seared to achieve a crispy exterior and a tender, juicy interior.
