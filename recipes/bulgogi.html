    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Bulgogi is a beloved Korean dish renowned for its savory-sweet flavor and tender
      texture. The name "bulgogi" translates to "fire meat," reflecting the traditional
      method of cooking thinly sliced marinated beef over high heat. The marinade,
      a harmonious blend of soy sauce, sugar, sesame oil, and garlic, infuses the meat
      with a rich, umami depth, while a touch of pear or apple adds a subtle sweetness.
      This combination creates a mouthwatering balance that makes bulgogi a standout
      favorite in Korean cuisine.

      or sandwiches. The dish's versatility and delightful flavor profile have made it a
      popular choice not only in Korean households but also in Korean restaurants around
      the world. Whether you are savoring it in its traditional form or experimenting with
