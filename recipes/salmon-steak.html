    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Salmon steak is a flavorful and versatile dish that is perfect for both casual meals and
      special occasions. This dish features thick, juicy cuts of salmon that are pan-seared to
      achieve a crispy exterior while keeping the interior tender and succulent. The rich, slightly
      sweet flavor of the salmon is enhanced with a simple seasoning of salt and pepper, and a
      touch of lemon juice adds a refreshing citrus note that complements the fish beautifully.

      For an added layer of depth, the salmon steaks can be served with a side of garlic butter
      or a fresh herb sauce. This dish pairs wonderfully with a variety of sides, from roasted
      vegetables to a light salad, making it a great choice for a balanced and satisfying meal.
      Whether you are cooking for a family dinner or entertaining guests, salmon steak is sure to
      impress with its ease of preparation and elegant presentation.
